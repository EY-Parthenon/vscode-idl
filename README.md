# VS Code IDL (Interactive Data Language) Extension

This extension adds syntax highlighting and code snippets for the Interactive Data Language (IDL) from Harris Geospatial Solutions (formerly Research Systems, Inc.).

The TextMate files and code snippets are originally from Mike Galloy's [idl.tmbundle](https://github.com/mgalloy/idl.tmbundle).

## Features

* Support for VSCode's auto-comment (Ctrl+/ or command+/)

* Syntax highlighting and coloring

* Code snippets for common code blocks

**Note:** The actual code that gets highlighted is strongly dependent on your theme. Themes such as Abyss, Atom One Dark (extension), Dark+ (default dark), or Monokai show the most color. 

## Known Issues

When you have code blocks from line continuations(the `$`), sometimes the first argument of the next line of the form `name` or `name,` will become highlighted as a procedure.

## Release Notes

See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).
